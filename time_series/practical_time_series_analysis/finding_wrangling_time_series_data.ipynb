A spectrum is a plot of light wavelength versus intensity. Here we see a time series classification task where there is no passage of time at all. Time series analysis applies because there is a unique and meaningful ordering of x-axis, which a concrete meaning of distance along that axis. Time series analysis distinguishes itself from cross-sectional analysis by using the additional information provided by ordering on the x-axis, whether it is time or wavelength, or something else."
